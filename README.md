# headless-cms-blog
A blog made with NextJS, GraphQL and WordPress (CMS). I have also integrated SWR ( "With SWR, components will get a stream of data updates constantly and automatically. And the UI will be always fast and reactive." )

## Errors
I try to load my blog posts to the single page and shows a 404 error.

I am really not understanding why and any help would be great.

This is the error in my terminal when I try to click on the blog post and go to the single page:

<code>error - ./pages/blog/[slug].js Attempted import error: 'getAllPostsWithSlug' is not exported from '../../pages/api/blog'.</code>
